# Summit ML on GitHub

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Summit ML. Here, we share the code, projects, and innovations that drive our mission in advancing artificial intelligence technologies.

## Our Repositories

Our GitHub hosts a range of repositories from open-source projects, internal tools, to client-specific work. Each repository adheres to a set of naming conventions to ensure clarity and organization.

### Naming Conventions

- **Products:** Repositories for our products are named directly after the product itself, in all lowercase and using dashes for spaces. Examples include `amorti` and `dataexpandr`.
- **Utilities and Tools:** For tools, including environments and libraries, names describe their function while following the lowercase and dash convention, such as `jupyter-docker`.
- **Client Projects:** Client-related projects follow the format `client-client-name`, ensuring easy identification and consistency.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to our open-source projects. Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the respective repository for guidelines on how to contribute effectively.
